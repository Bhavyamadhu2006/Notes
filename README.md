# Notes

This is completely focussed on JavaScript, the Programming language. Let's know how the Javascript works under the hood in this notes.

First important to know while coding. "DO NOT IMITATE, UNDERSTAND!"

Set up: We need 2 things
     a) Internet Browser with developer tools (Ex: Chrome)
     b) The text Editor (I prefer Visual studio code)

Big Word Alert:

"SYNTAX PARSER"
  1. A Program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.
  2. Implementing the syntax in a way, a computer can understand.

"LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT":
  1. Where Something sits physically in the code you write.
  2. "Lexical" means "having to do with words or grammar". A Lexical environment exists in programming languages
  in which where you write something is important.

"EXECUTION CONTEXT":
  1. A Wrapper to help manage the code that is running
  2. There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts.
     It can contain things beyond what you have written in the code.


CONCEPTUAL ASIDE: Name/Value Pairs And Objects
  A name which maps to a unique value
  The name may be defined more than once, but only van have one value in any given context
  That value may be more Name/Value pairs.

  OBJECT: A Collection of Name Value Pairs
